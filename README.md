# React + Vite
Farm Management App

This project is a Farm Management application designed to help users track expenses, plan future objectives, and schedule events efficiently. Key features include:

Expense tracking – monitor and manage farm-related expenses.

Planning & goal setting – organize future plans and objectives for the farm.

Calendar events – add and manage events using a calendar interface.

The application is built with:

React + Vite – for a modern, fast frontend.

Material-UI – for a clean and responsive user interface.

React Router – to experiment with routing and navigation.

This project demonstrates practical skills in state management, UI design, and routing while providing a useful tool for farm management.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
